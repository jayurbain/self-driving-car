scp model2.py carnd@34.207.99.4:~/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/.

In case this helps anyone.

I ran the simulator and then quit the simulator and then tried running the simulator again but drive.py could not connect. this is because drive.py is still using the port.

in this case kill the python process that is using the port.

Run sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP

Then sudo kill -9 PID


python drive.py -h model99.h5 data/IMG

cd documents
cd machine_learning
cd projects
cd CarND-Behavioral-Cloning
(source) activate carnd-term1
python drive.py model.json




with open('model.json', 'w') as fd:
   json.dump(model.to_json(), fd)
model.save_weights('model.h5')
