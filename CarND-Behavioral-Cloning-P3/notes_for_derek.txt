DeepSequenceLearningIntro project:

I've checked the activity training data into the git hub repository. You can also use the data link
at the top of the notebook

If you have not already cloned the directory:
git clone https://github.com/jayurbain/DeepSequenceLearningIntro.git

If you've already performed a git clone, perform a git pull.

Make sure you are using the correct environment:
conda env create -f environment.yml

Run the following jupyter notebook. There are several models to try.
human_activity_recognition-LSTM-Keras.ipynb

CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3 project:

If you have not already cloned the directory:
git clone https://github.com/jayurbain/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3.git

If you've already performed a git clone, perform a git pull.

# Envronment setup: 
# install conda or mini-conda: https://conda.io/miniconda.html
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ source activate carnd-term1

# cd to 'CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3' root directory

# Building a model
# executed within 'CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3' root directory
# --data - subdirectory of images for training
# --h5modelout - learned output model .h5
# --model - machine learning model name - see top of model.py source for different models to select

python model.py --data data --h5modeloutput model_commaAiModelPrime_e06252018.h5 --model commaAiModelPrime

# Testing with the simulator
Step 1)
python drive.py model_commaAiModelPrime_e06252018.h5 

2) Run the Udacity car simulator (I can do this for you). I think this is it, but I'm rusty.
